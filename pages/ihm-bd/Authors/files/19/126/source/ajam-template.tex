\section{General Instruction}
\label{S:1}Divide your paper into sections (or subsections, if necessary), and format it by the headings. Use bold letter for each heading with a heading number, and align each heading to the left. Heading is independent short paragraph. Subsection headings are same as section headings, but they are not bold face.Each author must prepare a camera-ready manuscript and lay it out within 4 pages with black and white figures, halftone figures and/or tables in place. 

AJAM will be produced by a photo-offset process directly from the pages supplied by the authors. Please check your paper carefully when sending the final camera-ready manuscript. The way you submit your manuscript is the way you will see it in print. The guidelines of camera-ready manuscript are described below.

\section{Page, Size and Text Area}

AJAM\footnote{ALGERIAN JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MATERIALS}
The printed page size of AJAM will be B5 (182 x 257 mm). Authors can use standard A4 (210 x 297 mm) stationery for printing camera-ready paper. Page margins should be 18 mm on the top and bottom, and 15 mm both sides. Pages will be reduced to the B5 size in the printing process.

\subsection{\bf Title, Author(s) and Affiliation(s)}
Use flush left for Title, author(s) and affiliation(s) in FULL TEXT WIDTH. Title must appear first, written in bold face and font size 14 pt. MAKE ONE LINE SPACE after title. Author's names are written in an order: given name, middle name, and surname. If an author has middle name, write only an initial for either first or middle name. Use font size 12 pt for author's name and 11 pt for affiliation. You do not have to use bold face for author's name. Affiliation(s) follow after author(s). If author’s affiliations are different, use numbers for indicating each author's affiliation. Numbers are superscripted and located at the end of each author's name. Superscripted numbers are located at the head of each corresponding affiliation. Add a superscript asterisk at the end of the speaker’s name. Author(s) and affiliation(s) should be center aligned and written in full text width. MAKE ONE LINE SPACE between affiliation and the abstract.

Full papers contain original scientific work that has not been published previously. However, work that has appeared in print in a short form such as a communication is  acceptable. Please note that the Society strongly discourages the fragmentation of a substantial body of work into a number of short publications.

\subsection{Font Face and Size}
\label{S:2}

All manuscripts must be written in English except proper nouns; names, affiliations, places, etc. Use font face Times Roman (Times New Roman) [2] or Century with a size of 11 points for main body. If your word processing system does not support above fonts, use the font close to them (like Dutch).

\section{Figures}
\label{S:1}
For both fine drawings and photographs, the legibility of the illustration is vital. Clearly label each figure and number them consecutively. Cite all illustrations in the text consecutively and place the figures as close as possible to their first mention in the text. For images, grayscale figures or hatched area, you must be careful that they are reproduced in offset printing with a 86 percent reduction from A4 to B5 sizes. Too fine images or too narrow hatched lines may not be reproduced in offset printing. Reduce figures within single or full width.

Full width figures are suggested to be placed at the head or bottom of the page. Place figure captions below the illustration. Type the word "Figure 1" and then type the caption in 11 point font face same as the main body of text. Use Fig. 1 or Figure 1 when you cite figures in the text. You need not center the caption even it is shorter than the text width.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering

\caption{An example of single width figure

\label{fig:view}
\end{figure}

Papers must highlight the impact and significance of the work for a materials readership to establish the suitability of the article for Algerian Journal of Advanced Materials. Papers that report incremental or derivative research should be directed to a more specialized journal.

\section{Equations}

Number all equations by enclosing in parentheses, and place the equation number to end at the light-hand margin. Equation numbers must be sequential. You can use sub numbering for equation numbers, if necessary. Make equations clear and legible, centered, with a space above and below. Place each equation on a separate line. Equations should be the same point size as the text. Please follow the standard style when writing equations: italics for variables, bold face for vectors, etc. Width of equation is within the column width. When you write long equations, you may think it is better to write equations in full width. In such a case, you can change the page style from a two column page to a full-width single column page.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:emc}
e = mc^2
\end{equation}

\section{Tables}
Full papers contain original scientific work that has not been published previously. However, work that has appeared in print in a short form such as a communication is  acceptable. Please note that the Society strongly discourages the fragmentation of a substantial body of work into a number of short publications.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{S:2}

Type the word "References" as a heading in bold. For each reference, a dangling indent with 4 or 6 mm is preferable rather than numbering. For a journal paper: Last name(s) and initial(s) of author(s), year of publication, title of paper, name of journal (preferably in italic), volume number (bold), inclusive page numbers with hyphen.
